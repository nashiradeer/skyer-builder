# Skyer Builder for Unity

Skyer Builder is a tool created to help you build your game or application in Unity to multiple platforms with one click.

## What exactly does Skyer Builder do?

The Skyer Builder creates a standard of the targets provided by Unity to be cross version and unify the target and target group in only one enumeration value, simplifying the build process from code, this is necessary to another function of the Skyer Builder, that is the possibility of build, multiple Unity Players, using a step system that can be accessed from code or Unity Editor UI.

## How to use Skyer Builder?

You can use our window from Unity Editor, you can access it from `Window` > `Skyer Builder`. In the window, the process is very intuitive, you only choose a path by clicking on `...` and click on any checkbox, ending with only one click on the `Build` button to start the build process.

Another way to use the Skyer Builder is by accessing the Skyer Builder Engine directly from code, in the [wiki of Skyer Builder in the GitLab](https://gitlab.com/deersoftware/skyerbuilder/-/wikis/home), you can view the documentation on how to use the Skyer Builder Engine.

## My target isn't supported by Skyer Builder

If this occurs, you can do two things to solve this question. You can create an Issue requesting official support for your target. You can also add support for your target by using your hands, forking or modifying locally the Skyer Builder source. If you want to learn how to modify the Skyer Builder, you can access our wiki, there has an explication of how you can do this.
