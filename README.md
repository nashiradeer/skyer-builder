## No dependencies

Skyer Builder does not depend on dependencies or external tools, for the Skyer Engine to work it uses the Unity BuildPipeline itself available natively in Unity, so you don't need to worry about dependencies or licenses besides Skyer itself.

## How to use Skyer Builder?

There are 3 ways to use Skyer, either through the window in Editor (located at `Window > Skyer Builder`), through the command line or directly through the code using scripts.

*Currently no official source explaining how Skyer Builder can be used from the command line or scripts.*

## My target isn't supported by Skyer Builder

Although Skyer Builder can be modified, the most recommended so far is to open an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/nashiradeer/skyer-builder/issues) asking for support, while there is no documentation explaining how to add custom targets in Skyer.

## How to download Skyer Builder?

You can install it from [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/209104) or directly from the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/nashiradeer/skyer-builder), downloading the [Unity Package from here](https://github.com/nashiradeer/skyer-builder/releases) or adding a package from the git URL "<https://github.com/nashiradeer/skyer-builder.git>" in the Unity Package Manager.
