## What exactly does Skyer Builder do?

The Skyer Builder creates a standard on top of the API provided by Unity to be easier to manipulate than the original, simplifying the build process from code, and making it possible to build multiple Unity Players or use an external UI like a command line or an Editor Window.

## How to use Skyer Builder?

You can use our window from Unity Editor, you can access it from `Window > Skyer Builder`. In the window, the process is very intuitive, you only choose a path by clicking on `...` and clicking on any checkbox, ending with only one click on the `Build` button to start the build process.

Another way to use the Skyer Builder is using code, in the [wiki of Skyer Builder in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/deersoftware/skyerbuilder/-/wikis/home), you can view the documentation on how to use it.
